## Workflow 1: Design and Analyze an A/B Test

1. **Define hypothesis** -- State the null and alternative hypotheses. Identify the primary metric (e.g., conversion rate, revenue per user).
2. **Calculate sample size** -- `python scripts/experiment_designer.py --input data/ --output results/`
   - Specify minimum detectable effect (MDE), significance level (alpha=0.05), and power (0.80).
   - Example: For baseline conversion 5%, MDE 10% relative lift, need ~31,000 users per variant.
3. **Randomize assignment** -- Use hash-based assignment on user ID for deterministic, reproducible splits.
4. **Run experiment** -- Monitor for sample ratio mismatch (SRM) daily. Flag if observed ratio deviates >1% from expected.
5. **Analyze results:**
   ```python
   from scipy import stats

   # Two-proportion z-test for conversion rates
   control_conv = control_successes / control_total
   treatment_conv = treatment_successes / treatment_total
   z_stat, p_value = stats.proportions_ztest(
       [treatment_successes, control_successes],
       [treatment_total, control_total],
       alternative='two-sided'
   )
   # Reject H0 if p_value < 0.05
   ```
6. **Validate** -- Check for novelty effects, Simpson's paradox across segments, and pre-experiment balance on covariates.

## Workflow 2: Build a Feature Engineering Pipeline

1. **Profile raw data** -- `python scripts/feature_engineering_pipeline.py --target project/ --analyze`
   - Identify null rates, cardinality, distributions, and data types.
2. **Generate candidate features:**
   - Temporal: day-of-week, hour, recency, frequency, monetary (RFM)
   - Aggregation: rolling means/sums over 7d/30d/90d windows
   - Interaction: ratio features, polynomial combinations
   - Text: TF-IDF, embedding vectors
3. **Select features** -- Remove features with >95% null rate, near-zero variance, or >0.95 pairwise correlation. Use recursive feature elimination or SHAP importance.
4. **Validate** -- Confirm no target leakage (no features derived from post-outcome data). Check train/test distribution alignment.
5. **Register** -- Store features in feature store with versioning and lineage metadata.

## Workflow 3: Train and Evaluate a Model

1. **Split data** -- Stratified train/validation/test split (70/15/15). For time series, use temporal split (no future leakage).
2. **Train baseline** -- Start with a simple model (logistic regression, gradient boosted trees) to establish a benchmark.
3. **Tune hyperparameters** -- Use Optuna or cross-validated grid search. Log all runs to MLflow.
4. **Evaluate on held-out test set:**
   ```python
   from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, roc_auc_score

   y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
   y_prob = model.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]

   print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
   print(f"AUC-ROC: {roc_auc_score(y_test, y_prob):.4f}")
   ```
5. **Validate** -- Check calibration (predicted probabilities match observed rates). Evaluate fairness metrics across protected groups. Confirm no overfitting (train vs test gap <5%).

## Workflow 4: Deploy a Model to Production

1. **Containerize** -- Package model with inference dependencies in Docker:
   ```bash
   docker build -t model-service:v1 .
   ```
2. **Set up serving** -- Deploy behind a REST API with health check, input validation, and structured error responses.
3. **Configure monitoring:**
   - Input drift: compare incoming feature distributions to training baseline (KS test, PSI)
   - Output drift: monitor prediction distribution shifts
   - Performance: track latency P50/P95/P99 targets (<50ms / <100ms / <200ms)
4. **Enable canary deployment** -- Route 5% traffic to new model, compare metrics against baseline for 24-48 hours.
5. **Validate** -- `python scripts/model_evaluation_suite.py --config config.yaml --deploy` confirms serving latency, error rate <0.1%, and model outputs match offline evaluation.

## Workflow 5: Perform Causal Inference

1. **Assess assignment mechanism** -- Determine if treatment was randomized (use experiment analysis) or observational (use causal methods below).
2. **Select method** based on data structure:
   - **Propensity Score Matching**: when treatment is binary, many covariates available
   - **Difference-in-Differences**: when pre/post data available for treatment and control groups
   - **Regression Discontinuity**: when treatment assigned by threshold on running variable
   - **Instrumental Variables**: when unobserved confounding present but valid instrument exists
3. **Check assumptions** -- Parallel trends (DiD), overlap/positivity (PSM), continuity (RDD).
4. **Estimate treatment effect** and compute confidence intervals.
5. **Validate** -- Run placebo tests (apply method to pre-treatment period, expect null effect). Sensitivity analysis for unobserved confounding.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Sample size calculation returns unreasonably large numbers | Minimum detectable effect (MDE) is set too small relative to baseline variance | Increase MDE to a practically meaningful threshold or accept longer experiment duration |
| Feature pipeline reports high null rates across all generated features | Source data contains upstream ingestion gaps or schema drift | Validate raw data completeness before running the pipeline; check ETL logs for failed loads |
| Model AUC drops significantly on validation vs. training set | Overfitting due to high-cardinality features or insufficient regularization | Apply stronger regularization, reduce feature set, or increase training data volume |
| Experiment shows significant results but large confidence intervals | Insufficient sample size or high metric variance | Extend experiment runtime, increase traffic allocation, or switch to a variance-reduction technique (CUPED) |
| Deployed model latency exceeds P95 targets | Model complexity too high for serving infrastructure or missing batching | Quantize the model, reduce input feature count, or enable request batching on the serving layer |
| Feature importance scores are unstable across cross-validation folds | Correlated features cause importance to shift between redundant predictors | Remove highly correlated features (>0.95) before training or use permutation importance with repeated runs |
| Causal inference estimates show implausible treatment effects | Violation of parallel trends assumption (DiD) or poor covariate overlap (PSM) | Run diagnostic tests (placebo checks, overlap histograms) and consider alternative identification strategies |

---

## Success Criteria

- **Model discrimination**: AUC-ROC above 0.85 on held-out test set for classification tasks
- **Calibration quality**: Brier score below 0.15; predicted probabilities within 5% of observed rates across decile bins
- **Feature coverage**: Feature importance analysis accounts for at least 90% of cumulative model importance
- **Experiment power**: All A/B tests designed with statistical power of 0.80 or higher at the specified MDE
- **Deployment readiness**: Model serving latency under 100ms at P95; error rate below 0.1%
- **Reproducibility**: All experiments and training runs logged with full parameter tracking; results reproducible from logged artifacts
- **Data quality**: Input feature pipelines maintain less than 2% null rate on critical features after imputation
