## Best Practices

### Qualification Tips
1. **Ask open-ended questions**: Get context, not just yes/no
2. **Verify, don't assume**: Confirm information directly
3. **Document everything**: Keep CRM updated
4. **Re-qualify regularly**: Situations change
5. **Know when to walk away**: Time is valuable

### Common Mistakes
- Qualifying too quickly
- Ignoring red flags
- Not identifying all stakeholders
- Assuming budget = ability to buy
- Forgetting to re-qualify over time

## Limitations

- Cannot access CRM data directly
- Scoring requires defined criteria from user
- Cannot verify provided information
- Qualification is guidance, not guarantee
- Human judgment still essential
