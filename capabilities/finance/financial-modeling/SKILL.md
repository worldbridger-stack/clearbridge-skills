# Financial Modeling Skill

## Overview

I help you build integrated 3-statement financial models that link Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement. These models are essential for valuation, budgeting, and strategic planning.

**What I can do:**
- Build income statement projections
- Create balance sheet forecasts
- Generate cash flow statements
- Model working capital requirements
- Build debt schedules and interest calculations
- Create scenario analysis (base/bull/bear cases)

**What I cannot do:**
- Access real-time financial data
- Guarantee projection accuracy
- Provide accounting advice
- Replace professional financial analysis

## How to Use Me

### Step 1: Provide Historical Data

I need 2-3 years of:
- Income statement (revenue, COGS, operating expenses)
- Balance sheet (assets, liabilities, equity)
- Cash flow statement (optional but helpful)

### Step 2: Define Projection Assumptions

Key drivers:
- Revenue growth rate
- Gross margin
- Operating expense ratios
- Capex as % of revenue
- Working capital days (DSO, DIO, DPO)

### Step 3: Choose Model Scope

- **Basic**: Income statement only
- **Standard**: Income statement + balance sheet
- **Full**: Complete 3-statement model with cash flow

### Key Formulas

#### Income Statement Drivers
```
Revenue = Prior Year × (1 + Growth Rate)
COGS = Revenue × (1 - Gross Margin %)
Gross Profit = Revenue - COGS
SG&A = Revenue × SG&A %
EBITDA = Gross Profit - SG&A
D&A = Prior PP&E × D&A Rate OR Revenue × D&A %
EBIT = EBITDA - D&A
Interest = Avg Debt × Interest Rate
EBT = EBIT - Interest
Taxes = EBT × Tax Rate
Net Income = EBT - Taxes
```

#### Balance Sheet Drivers
```
Accounts Receivable = Revenue × (DSO / 365)
Inventory = COGS × (DIO / 365)
Accounts Payable = COGS × (DPO / 365)
PP&E = Prior PP&E + Capex - D&A
Retained Earnings = Prior RE + Net Income - Dividends
Cash = Total Liabilities + Equity - Other Assets (plug)
```

#### Cash Flow Statement
```
Operating Cash Flow:
  Net Income
  + D&A (non-cash)
  - Increase in AR
  - Increase in Inventory
  + Increase in AP
  = Cash from Operations

Investing Cash Flow:
  - Capex
  = Cash from Investing

Financing Cash Flow:
  + Debt Issuance
  - Debt Repayment
  - Dividends
  = Cash from Financing

Net Change in Cash = CFO + CFI + CFF
```

## Tips for Better Results

1. **Provide clean historical data** in a consistent format
2. **Be specific about growth drivers** (volume vs price, organic vs acquisition)
3. **Specify industry context** for appropriate benchmarks
4. **Ask for scenario analysis** to understand range of outcomes
5. **Request sensitivity tables** for key assumptions

---

## Limitations

- Projections are only as good as the assumptions
- Cannot model complex corporate structures
- Does not account for one-time items automatically
- Simplified tax calculations
- Currency assumed constant (no FX modeling)
